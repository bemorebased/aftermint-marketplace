Now, I'm ready to dive into the frontend discussion. Tell me all about your vision for it!
To help structure our discussion, maybe you can tell me about:In general its good the whole website to be responsive and good for mobile as well.

1.  **Overall Look and Feel:**
    *   Any specific design style in mind (e.g., modern, minimalist, dark mode, light mode, a particular theme)?
    *   Any existing NFT marketplaces whose design you particularly like (or dislike)?
    *   Branding elements (logo, color scheme if you have one)?I want to have 3 themes: dark, kek and based. They all must be minimalistic and pleasant to look at.
I like the design of blur.io and opensea 2.0The name of the marketplace is ‘AfterMint’

2.  **Key Pages/Views:**
    *   Homepage (what should it highlight? Trending collections? Featured NFTs?)
    *   Marketplace page (browsing/filtering all listings)
    *   Collection page (viewing all NFTs within a specific collection)
    *   NFT detail page (showing individual NFT, its history, listing/buy/offer options)
    *   User profile/portfolio page (showing a user's owned NFTs, created listings, active offers, past activity)
    *   Create listing page
    *   Subscription management page- Homepage should have featured collection, trending collection. I want these to be having 2 type of views - based view and trader view. Based view is a gallery like grid with focus on collection name, token ID, floor (or price) while the trader must have more details like last sale and owner.- marketplace should display all collections, again in Based view (gallery) or Trader view (list)
- Colelction page keeps the same logic, displays 20 NFTs per page, also with options to view them Based/Trader, where on mouse over it should have a button “Buy Now”. It should have 4 icons for sorting, the default way being Price Low to High, but also have High to low and ID both ways too.
- NFT detail page should have its id, price, offers (if there are any), history, last sale, owner
- User profile/portfolio should display what you suggested and also option to subscribe for 7 days, 30 days or 365 days and maybe following the status at it.
- Create listing page - im not sure what this is, but I as an owner would need to have a good template that I could add new collection easily and quickly
3.  **Core Functionality (from a user's perspective):**
    *   Connecting a wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
Metamask, rabby, coinable wallet are are nice options, wallet connect or whatever makes it most convenient for users
    *   Browsing and filtering NFTs (by collection, price, traits, status, etc.)
Yes
    *   Viewing NFT details (metadata, image/media, price history, ownership history)
Yes
    *   Listing an NFT for sale (public, private, with/without expiration)
The défault one must be public
    *   Cancelling a listing
Yes
    *   Updating a listing's price
Yes but minimalistic view
    *   Buying an NFT (direct buy)
Yes
    *   Making an offer on an NFT
Yes
    *   Cancelling an offer
Yes
    *   Accepting an offer
Yes
    *   Floor sweeping (buying multiple NFTs from a collection's floor)
Yes from 2 to 10 with a slider that changes color from blue to cyan (max)
    *   Purchasing/managing marketplace subscriptions
Yes keep the structure at 7 days 1000 $based, 30 days 3000 $based or 365 days 25000 $based 
    *   Notifications (e.g., offer received, item sold - though this often requires off-chain services or more advanced frontend polling)
This would be cool but keeping it into the frontend only when a user is logged makes sense and easies to do?

4.  **Information Display:**
    *   How should collection stats be shown (floor price, volume, sales, owners)?
Yes these are all needed, displayed in a minimalistic view/way
    *   How should historical data (sales, price changes, offers) be presented?
These must be when into a collections own page, learn from Blur marketplace
    *   Display of LifeNodes NFT holder discount and subscription benefits.
Yep with like discounted fee icon or some other cool way to highlight it

5.  **Technology Stack (if you have preferences):**
    *   Frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.)?
    *   Styling (Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, Material UI, etc.)?
    *   State management (Redux, Zustand, Pinia, Vuex, etc.)?
    *   Any specific libraries for interacting with Ethereum (ethers.js is common and works well with Hardhat)?- whatever works best for the goals, 

The more detail you can provide, the better I can understand your requirements and help plan the frontend development. Let's build something awesome!
