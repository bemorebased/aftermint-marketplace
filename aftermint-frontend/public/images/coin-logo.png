This file should be replaced with an actual PNG image of a coin logo.

For now, you should use one of these options:
1. Copy a suitable coin logo image to this location
2. Update the code to use a different image that exists in your project
3. Use an SVG logo directly in the component instead of referencing this file

The file path should be: public/images/coin-logo.png
